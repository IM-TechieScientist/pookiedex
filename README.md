# PookieDex

Context Aware Peer Finder App

## Tech Stack

**Client:** Flutter

**Server:** FireBase, FireStore, Gemini API (future plans)


## Features

- Cross platform
- Share Contacts and Profiles instantly through QR Codes
- Contacts and Details Update with time
- Find Peer Groups based on Context Aware ML models
For example, if you're looking for someone who's interested into Front End Development, what do you do?

You search them on Instagram? You put countless messages on common class groups, Hoping the 1 in a 1000 front end dev sees it? 

On Instagram or LinkedIn, what if they put React instead of Three.js?

Instead of Pointless hunting, this context aware engine classifies Three.js and React both as Front End. So when you search Front End, you get Three.js and React devs.
